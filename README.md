# Frontal-Alpha-Asymmetry-as-a-Biomarker-for-MDD
Abstract
Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) is a quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) measure of the difference in activity between the left frontal and right frontal lobes. It has been proposed that activity in the left frontal lobe is associated with “approach” (reward-seeking or goal-directed behavior), while activity in the right frontal is associated with “withdrawal” (avoidance or inhibition) - this is known as Davidson’s Approach-Withdrawal model. Based on current research, the evidence linking Frontal Alpha Asymmetry (FAA) directly to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is inconsistent. Nonetheless, the objective of this study is to evaluate FAA as a biomarker for depression using a publicly available dataset, by comparing resting-state alpha activity in patients with MDD versus healthy controls.
Methods: The data were processed using the MNE-Python library. Preprocessing included bandpass filtering (1–40 Hz), notch filtering (50 Hz), and artifact rejection through amplitude thresholding. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was estimated using Welch’s method to extract alpha band power (8–13 Hz). FAA scores were calculated using the difference in natural logarithms of right and left electrode activity, i.e. ln(F4) – ln(F3).
Results: T-tests revealed a statistically significant difference in asymmetry scores between groups (t = -2.40, p = 0.023). The healthy control group exhibited a higher mean FAA score (M = 0.22) compared to the MDD group (M = 0.06). The findings indicate significantly reduced relative left-frontal activity in the MDD group compared to the Healthy group. This supports the hypothesis that there exists a deficit in “approach” mechanisms in depressed subjects.
